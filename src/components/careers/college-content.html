            Starbucks believes in the promise and pursuit of the American Dream.
            According to the U.S. Department of Education, only half of
            Americans who begin college today will actually finish, largely due
            to financial and work / life barriers. In the U.S., we are on the
            verge of seeing an entire generation of young people left behind due
            in part to skyrocketing tuition costs that prevent more and more
            people from starting or finishing their undergraduate degree. To
            address this growing inequality in America, Starbucks partnered with
            a like-minded university who recognizes the need to address one of
            the single most important challenges facing young adults, and our
            U.S. partners, today - earning a bachelor’s degree. We’re in a
            position to help. Investing in our partners and education is one of
            the very best investments Starbucks can make.

            high-quality education, at scale, to all of our eligible U.S.

            proud to partner with an academic institution that recognizes the
            need for innovation to offer more people an opportunity of a quality
            higher education, and the freedom to pursue their passions in any
